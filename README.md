# D&D Companion App

This project was developed by myself over the course of two months for my Mobile Programming course at Haaga-Helia, Business Information Technology program, 4th semester

## Dependencies/Tools/Libraries

This project utilizes the aforementioned tools and libraries

* `create-react-native-app` for bootstrapping
* `native-base` for the components and styling options
* `react-navigation` for StackNavigation / DrawerNavigation
* `react-native-autocomplete-input` for autocompleting text field in the Spell Book
* `AsyncStorage` from `react-native` for storing arrays

## Description

The app aims to be a useful companion app for players of Dungeons & Dragons, offering several features that would be useful in playing or running a game:

* A random dice roller, from d4 dice to d100
* An initiative tracker, to aid tracking turns in combat rounds
* A spell book, to save commonly used spells for quick lookup
* A random name generator, for when you need to create a NPC (Non player character) quickly and give them a name
