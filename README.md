# D&D Companion

This project was developed by myself from April 7th to May 2nd as my final assignment for my Mobile Programming course, which was part of my Business Information degree program at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. 

## Dependencies/Tools/Libraries/APIs

This project utilizes the aforementioned tools and libraries

>* `create-react-native-app` for bootstrapping
>* `native-base` for the components and styling options
>* `react-navigation` for StackNavigation / DrawerNavigation
>* `react-native-autocomplete-input` for autocompleting text field in the Spell Book
>* `react-native-collapsible` for collapsible text for the Plot Hook component
>* `AsyncStorage` from `react-native` for storing arrays
>* `D&D 5e API` to search for spell information: check it out [here](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/ "D&D 5e API")

## Description

The app aims to be a useful companion app for players of Dungeons & Dragons, offering several features that would be useful in playing or running a game:

* A random dice roller, from d4 (4-sided) to d100
* An initiative tracker, to aid tracking turns in combat rounds
* A spell book, to save commonly used spells for quick lookup
* A random name generator, for when you need to create a NPC (Non player character) quickly and give them a name
* A list of plot hooks for use when starting a campaign or session
